# School-District-Analysis

## Overall Analysis
While public schools received more funding than charter schools, public schools had lower average reading and math scores. This trend continued when math scores were evaluated at each grade level, except 12th grade, where public schools had a slightly higher math score.

Additional analysis at the school level could identify high performing and low performing high schools that may be skewing these trends. Additionally, school size could also be evaluated in relation to math and reading scores to determine if there is impact in this area.
